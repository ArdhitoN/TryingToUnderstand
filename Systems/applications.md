# Foundations
Three things to consider for an application that is data-intensive:
1. Reliability
2. Scalability 
3. Maintainability


There are no one architecture that fits all of the problems. 
All depends on context or concretely the load parameters (which might be assumed esp. in unproven products): (1) intensity/volume: number of reqs/s? (2) size of data in each response? etc...
This is (kinda) similar to the concept of "No Free Lunch Theorem" from Machine Learning, where there is no particular model's learning algorithm that could be the best amongst all problems or datasets.
