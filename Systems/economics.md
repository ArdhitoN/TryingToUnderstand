## Foundations
* Traditional economy view: economy could be seen as constrained optimizations. In the beginning, all was trying to understand the historical economy, but then it all shifted
  to lean into natural science, trying to make predictive models. This view is being criticized as it assumes a perfect, known model of what is really happening in the process,
  whilst actually not. 

* Complex systems view: back to its first intention to economy, by analyzing it historically, but with another approach, i.e., simulations. The consequences is that traditional,
  mathematical principles from previous traditional view are dissipating, where no more rigorous statistical significance test, etc.

* We may break down the economical agents into:
  * nations (government + central bank)
  * businesses
  * individuals 

Breaking down economic sectors...

## Businesses
* For businesses, we can clasify them based on their operating industries. 
* Industry is a subset of sector.
* A business that operate within > 1 sector is called conglomeration.
